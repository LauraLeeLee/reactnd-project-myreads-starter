# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. We were given a template to begin. The goal of this template is to save time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. If you choose to start with this template, your job will be to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.

## Access app:

#Loading the App
